## Architectural Overview

NIC Insight is a **LibreChat distribution** that transforms the base LibreChat into a comprehensive knowledge management platform. The architecture maintains full LibreChat compatibility while adding workspace intelligence through five integrated modules.

**Core Philosophy:** Non-invasive extension of LibreChat's native capabilities through wrapper components, context layering, and configuration-driven features.

## Module Architecture

### Module: Workspace Core

#### Conceptual Responsibility
Provides foundational workspace and project organization capabilities, enabling users to create logical boundaries around related documents and conversations.

#### Module Boundaries
- **Owns:** Workspace creation, project hierarchies, file organization within workspaces
- **Provides:** Workspace context to all other modules, project structures, file trees
- **Requires:** LibreChat's authentication system, file storage system, database connections

#### Integration Points
- **Authentication:** Integrates with LibreChat's user authentication for workspace ownership
- **File System:** Extends LibreChat's file handling with workspace organization
- **Database:** Adds workspace and project models to LibreChat's MongoDB schema
- **Routing:** Adds workspace routes to LibreChat's React Router configuration

#### Module Relationships
- **Context Management** consumes workspace structure for intelligent context selection
- **Document Intelligence** processes files within workspace boundaries
- **UI Extensions** displays workspace navigation and organization
- **Artifact Workspace** saves generated content back to workspace projects

---

### Module: Document Intelligence

#### Conceptual Responsibility
Handles intelligent document processing, analysis, and transformation within workspace contexts, providing rich metadata and content understanding.

#### Module Boundaries
- **Owns:** Document analysis, content extraction, metadata generation, format conversion
- **Provides:** Document insights to Context Management, processed content for AI conversations
- **Requires:** LibreChat's file processing pipeline, AI model access for analysis

#### Integration Points
- **File Processing:** Extends LibreChat's file upload pipeline with workspace-specific analysis
- **AI Integration:** Uses LibreChat's AI clients for document analysis and summarization
- **Storage:** Works with LibreChat's multi-backend storage system
- **Context System:** Provides processed document content to conversation contexts

#### Module Relationships
- **Workspace Core** provides organizational structure for document processing
- **Context Management** uses document intelligence for smart context selection
- **Artifact Workspace** transforms insights back into processable documents
- **UI Extensions** displays document analysis results and metadata

---

### Module: Context Management

#### Conceptual Responsibility
Manages intelligent context selection for AI conversations, including document pinning, @mentions, and relevance-based context building.

#### Module Boundaries
- **Owns:** Context algorithms, document selection logic, @mention parsing, context chips/pins
- **Provides:** Optimized context to LibreChat's conversation system, visual context indicators
- **Requires:** Workspace structure from Workspace Core, document intelligence from Document Intelligence

#### Integration Points
- **Chat System:** Layers context over LibreChat's existing conversation context
- **UI Input:** Enhances LibreChat's chat input with context selection capabilities
- **File System:** Integrates with workspace file organization for context building
- **AI Conversations:** Provides enhanced context to LibreChat's AI model interactions

#### Module Relationships
- **Workspace Core** provides the organizational foundation for context selection
- **Document Intelligence** provides processed content for context relevance algorithms
- **UI Extensions** displays context selection interface elements
- **Artifact Workspace** considers context when generating new documents

---

### Module: UI Extensions

#### Conceptual Responsibility
Provides enhanced user interface elements that integrate NIC Insight features into LibreChat's existing UI framework without replacing core components.

#### Module Boundaries
- **Owns:** Activity bar, enhanced sidebars, context chips, file explorer UI, theme extensions
- **Provides:** Visual interface for all workspace features, enhanced navigation
- **Requires:** LibreChat's theme system, component architecture, routing system

#### Integration Points
- **Theme System:** Extends LibreChat's light/dark/auto theme system
- **Navigation:** Adds workspace navigation to LibreChat's existing sidebar
- **Components:** Wraps LibreChat components with workspace-aware functionality
- **Layout:** Integrates with LibreChat's responsive layout system

#### Module Relationships
- **Workspace Core** provides data for file explorer and project navigation
- **Document Intelligence** displays document metadata and analysis results
- **Context Management** visualizes context selection and pinning
- **Artifact Workspace** provides interface for document generation and management

---

### Module: Artifact Workspace

#### Conceptual Responsibility
Extends LibreChat's artifacts system to generate, display, and manage workspace-integrated documents from AI insights and conversations.

#### Module Boundaries
- **Owns:** Document generation from AI insights, artifact-to-workspace integration, export capabilities
- **Provides:** Generated documents to workspace, enhanced artifact viewing, document templates
- **Requires:** LibreChat's artifacts system, AI model access, workspace storage

#### Integration Points
- **Artifacts System:** Extends LibreChat's existing artifacts panel and card system
- **AI Generation:** Uses LibreChat's AI clients for document generation
- **Workspace Storage:** Saves generated artifacts back to workspace projects
- **Export System:** Integrates with browser download APIs for document export

#### Module Relationships
- **Workspace Core** provides destination for generated documents
- **Document Intelligence** processes generated documents for future use
- **Context Management** uses workspace context to inform document generation
- **UI Extensions** displays artifact management and workspace integration controls

## Cross-Module Integration Patterns

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Workspace Context** flows from Workspace Core to all other modules
2. **Document Processing** flows from Document Intelligence to Context Management
3. **Context Selection** flows from Context Management to AI conversations
4. **Generated Content** flows from Artifact Workspace back to Workspace Core
5. **UI State** managed by UI Extensions coordinates all visual elements

### Event Coordination
- **Workspace Changes** trigger context re-evaluation and UI updates
- **Document Updates** trigger intelligence re-processing and context refresh
- **Context Selection** triggers conversation enhancement and UI feedback
- **Artifact Generation** triggers workspace integration and storage operations

### Configuration Integration
All modules integrate with LibreChat's configuration system (librechat.yaml) through the `interface.nicInsight` section:

```yaml
interface:
  nicInsight:
    workspaces: true
    documentIntelligence: true
    contextManagement: true
    artifactWorkspace: true
    enhancedUI: true
```

## Security and Permissions Model

### Module Security Boundaries
- **Workspace Core:** User-based workspace ownership, project-level permissions
- **Document Intelligence:** Respects LibreChat's file access controls
- **Context Management:** Workspace-scoped context isolation
- **UI Extensions:** User preference isolation
- **Artifact Workspace:** Workspace-scoped artifact management

### Data Isolation
- Each module respects LibreChat's user authentication and authorization
- Workspace boundaries provide additional data isolation layer
- All modules inherit LibreChat's security patterns and file handling

## Upgrade and Compatibility Strategy

### LibreChat Upstream Compatibility
- All modules designed as extensions, not replacements
- Core LibreChat functionality preserved and unmodified
- Configuration-driven feature activation
- Clean separation of NIC-specific code

### Future Extension Points
- Plugin system for additional document processors
- Custom workspace templates and organization patterns
- Enhanced AI model integration for specialized document tasks
- Advanced collaboration features within workspace boundaries
