# Workspace Concept for Document Browser

## Role
Act as a frontend developer specializing in workspace management systems and document source switching interfaces.

## Objective
Add the concept of workspace that allows deciding where files come from (folder or GitLab), with a workspace selector in the document browser panel.

## Context
The system needs a workspace concept to manage different file sources. Current requirements:

- Workspace concept implementation
- Workspace determines file source (folder or GitLab)
- Workspace selector in the document browser panel
- Switching workspace changes the panel content
- Switching workspace changes the file origin

The workspace acts as a context switcher that determines both the content displayed in the browser panel and the source from which files are retrieved.

## Instructions
Implement the following components:

1. **Workspace Concept**
   - Create workspace abstraction layer
   - Allow workspace to define file source (folder or GitLab)
   - Enable multiple workspace configurations

2. **Workspace Selector in Browser Panel**
   - Add workspace selector to document browser panel
   - Display current workspace selection
   - Enable workspace switching interface

3. **Dynamic Content Switching**
   - Switch browser panel content when workspace changes
   - Update file listings based on selected workspace
   - Maintain workspace state across sessions

4. **File Origin Management**
   - Configure file source per workspace
   - Support both local folder and GitLab origins
   - Handle authentication and access for different sources

## Notes
When alternating the workspace, the system consequently alternates the content displayed and the origin of the files. This creates a flexible document management system where users can switch between different file sources seamlessly through the workspace selector in the document browser panel.
