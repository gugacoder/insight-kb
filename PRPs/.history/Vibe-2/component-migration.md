**Key Migration Components:**
- **Import Standardization**: Consistent Winston import pattern across all components
- **Logging Method Preservation**: All specialized logging methods maintained
- **Metadata Structure**: Component-specific metadata preserved with service tagging
- **Test Mock Framework**: Comprehensive Winston logger mocking utilities

### Integration Points

**Standard Import Pattern:**
```javascript
// Standardized across all components
const logger = require('../../api/config/winston');
const { RageWinstonWrapper } = require('../logging/winston-integration');

// Create component-specific logger instance
const rageLogger = new RageWinstonWrapper(logger, {
  component: 'interceptor' // or 'enrichment', 'resilience', etc.
});
```

**Logging Method Preservation:**
```javascript
// All existing methods preserved
rageLogger.info(message, metadata, correlationId);
rageLogger.error(message, metadata, correlationId);
rageLogger.debug(message, metadata, correlationId);
rageLogger.performance(operation, duration, metrics, correlationId);
rageLogger.enrichment(phase, details, correlationId);
rageLogger.audit(event, details, correlationId);
rageLogger.apiOperation(operation, status, details, correlationId);
```

**Component-Specific Metadata:**
```javascript
// Enhanced metadata with component tagging
{
  timestamp: '2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z',
  level: 'info',
  service: 'rage',
  component: 'interceptor', // or enrichment, resilience, etc.
  message: 'Operation completed',
  correlationId: 'rage_1704110400000_abc123def',
  operation: 'enrichMessage',
  duration: 150
}
```
