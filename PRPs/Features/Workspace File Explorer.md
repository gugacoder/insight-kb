# Workspace File Explorer

## Context Snapshot
```yaml
module: UI Extensions + Workspace Core
dependencies: [Workspace Core Integration, Enhanced Activity Bar and Side Panel, LibreChat File System]
patterns_used: []
code_templates: []
ui_references: []
constraints: [Virtual file system, LibreChat file compatibility, Tree navigation, Real-time updates]
```

## Assumptions
- Workspace Core Integration is fully implemented with project hierarchy
- Enhanced Activity Bar provides workspace tool switching capability
- LibreChat's file upload and handling system is operational
- React tree rendering patterns are established
- Drag and drop APIs are available in target browsers

## Purpose

This feature provides an intuitive file explorer interface within the workspace side panel that displays hierarchical organization of documents and projects. It enables users to navigate their workspace structure, interact with files through double-click opening, and perform basic file operations while integrating seamlessly with LibreChat's existing file handling system and the new Artifacts Panel viewing capabilities.

## Scope

### Included Capabilities
- Hierarchical tree display of workspace projects and files
- Double-click file opening in Artifacts Panel
- File and folder icons with proper MIME type recognition
- Real-time tree updates when workspace content changes
- Basic file operations (rename, move, delete) with visual feedback
- File upload integration with drag-and-drop to specific folders
- Search/filter functionality within current workspace
- File context menu with workspace-specific actions

### Excluded from This Feature
- Real file system operations (uses virtual workspace structure only)
- File editing capabilities (handled by Artifacts Panel)
- File version history or backup functionality
- Advanced file sharing or collaboration features
- Integration with external file systems or cloud storage
- Bulk file operations beyond basic selection

## User Flow

### Primary Flow
1. **Initial Trigger**: User selects File Explorer from activity bar
2. **System Processing**: System loads current workspace file structure and renders tree
3. **UI Display**: File explorer shows hierarchical tree with folders/files, proper icons, and interaction states
4. **User Interaction**: User navigates tree, double-clicks files, or uses context menus for operations
5. **Final Outcome**: Selected file opens in Artifacts Panel, or file operation completes with visual feedback

### Success State
User sees:
- Complete workspace file tree with proper folder/file icons
- Clear visual hierarchy with expandable/collapsible folders
- Active file highlighting and proper selection states
- Smooth tree updates when files are added/removed
- Context menus with relevant file operations

### Error Handling Flow
- **File Load Error**: Corrupted file reference → Tree shows error icon → User sees "file unavailable" message
- **Operation Error**: Failed rename/move/delete → Operation reverts → User notified with specific error
- **Tree Update Error**: Failed real-time update → Tree shows stale data → User can manually refresh
