# Smart Context Management System

## Context Snapshot
```yaml
module: Context Management
dependencies: [Workspace Core Integration, Document Intelligence, Workspace File Explorer, LibreChat Chat System]
patterns_used: []
code_templates: []
ui_references: []
constraints: [LibreChat chat integration, @mention parsing, Context chip UI, Real-time context updates]
```

## Assumptions
- Workspace Core provides document organization and file metadata
- Document Intelligence module provides processed document content and relevance scoring
- LibreChat's chat context system is operational and extensible
- Chat input component supports UI enhancements for context chips
- AI conversation system can accept enhanced context information

## Purpose

This feature implements intelligent context management for AI conversations by automatically selecting relevant documents from the active workspace and providing visual controls for users to pin, select, and manage conversation context. It enhances LibreChat's existing chat system with workspace-aware context building, @mention parsing for specific document references, and a visual chip system that shows users exactly which documents are being used as context for their AI conversations.

## Scope

### Included Capabilities
- Automatic context selection based on workspace content and conversation relevance
- Visual context chips/pins above chat input showing active context documents
- @mention parsing and autocompletion for specific document references
- Context selection from file explorer with "use as context" functionality
- Real-time context updates as workspace content changes
- Context relevance scoring and intelligent document ranking
- Context size management with intelligent truncation for AI model limits
- Visual indicators showing which documents are contributing to conversation context

### Excluded from This Feature
- Real-time document collaboration or multi-user context sharing
- Advanced semantic search or vector-based document similarity
- Context persistence across different conversations (each conversation manages its own context)
- Integration with external knowledge bases or APIs
- Advanced natural language processing beyond basic @mention parsing

## User Flow

### Primary Flow
1. **Initial Trigger**: User opens workspace chat or switches to workspace context
2. **System Processing**: Context manager analyzes workspace documents and selects relevant content based on conversation history
3. **UI Display**: Context chips appear above chat input showing selected documents with remove options
4. **User Interaction**: User can add/remove context via file explorer, @mentions, or chip management
5. **Final Outcome**: AI conversation receives optimized context with selected documents, user sees clear visual feedback

### Success State
User sees:
- Clear context chips above chat input showing active document context
- Working @mention autocompletion when typing document names
- Proper context updates when selecting "use as context" from file explorer
- Relevant document suggestions based on conversation content
- Context size indicator showing efficient context usage

### Error Handling Flow
- **Document Load Error**: Failed to load context document → Chip shows error state → User notified and can remove/retry
- **Context Size Error**: Context exceeds AI model limits → System intelligently truncates → User sees truncation indicator
- **@mention Error**: Invalid document reference → Autocomplete shows "not found" → User guided to valid options

- Relevance scoring must improve over time based on user interaction patterns
- Error states must provide clear recovery options and not break conversation flow
- Context size management must gracefully handle documents of varying sizes

## Integration Context

### System Integration Points
- **LibreChat Conversation System**: Context information layers over existing conversation context
- **Workspace File Explorer**: "Use as context" actions integrate with context selection
- **Document Intelligence**: Processed document content feeds into relevance scoring
- **LibreChat Chat Input**: @mention parsing and context chips integrate with existing input component
- **LibreChat AI Integration**: Enhanced context integrates with existing AI model communication

### Cross-Feature Relationships
- **Workspace Core Integration**: Context selection limited to active workspace documents
- **Document Intelligence**: Document processing results improve context relevance scoring
- **Workspace File Explorer**: File selection in explorer can add documents to conversation context
- **Artifact Workspace**: Generated artifacts can be automatically added to context for follow-up conversations

## Quality Standards

### Functional Quality

- @mention autocomplete provides suggestions within 150ms of typing
- Context size optimization maintains quality while respecting AI model token limits
- Relevance scoring produces consistent and intuitive document rankings

### Technical Quality
- Context state management uses immutable patterns for predictable updates
- @mention parsing handles edge cases (special characters, partial matches, invalid references)
- Memory usage remains constant regardless of workspace size through proper caching
- Error handling provides graceful degradation when document processing fails

### Integration Quality
- Context enhancements don't interfere with existing LibreChat conversation features
- Performance impact on chat response times is negligible (< 50ms overhead)
