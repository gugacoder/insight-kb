# Document Intelligence and Processing Engine

## Context Snapshot
```yaml
module: Document Intelligence
dependencies: [Workspace Core Integration, LibreChat File System, LibreChat AI Integration]
patterns_used: []
code_templates: []
ui_references: []
constraints: [LibreChat file compatibility, Processing pipeline, Metadata extraction, Content analysis]
```

## Assumptions
- LibreChat's file upload and processing system is operational and extensible
- Workspace Core provides document organization and file metadata
- LibreChat's AI model integration can be used for document analysis
- File processing can happen asynchronously without blocking user interface
- Browser APIs and libraries for document parsing (PDF, DOCX) are available

## Purpose

This feature provides intelligent document processing capabilities that analyze uploaded files within workspace contexts, extracting content, generating metadata, and creating searchable summaries that enhance context selection and document understanding. It extends LibreChat's existing file handling system with workspace-aware processing that improves the relevance and utility of documents for AI conversations while maintaining compatibility with all LibreChat file handling patterns.

## Scope

### Included Capabilities
- Automatic content extraction from supported file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, CSV)
- Document summarization and key concept extraction using AI analysis
- Metadata generation including document type classification, topic extraction, and content themes
- Content indexing for improved search and context relevance in Smart Context Management
- Processing status tracking with progress indicators and error handling
- Integration with LibreChat's existing file upload pipeline
- Workspace-scoped processing that respects document organization and user permissions

### Excluded from This Feature
- Real-time collaborative document editing or version control
- Advanced OCR processing for image-based documents beyond basic text extraction
- External API integration for document analysis (processing must use LibreChat's existing AI models)
- Full-text search engine implementation (provides processed content for other features to use)
- Complex document layout analysis or advanced formatting preservation

## User Flow

### Primary Flow
1. **Initial Trigger**: User uploads document to workspace or existing workspace document is analyzed
2. **System Processing**: Document enters processing queue and content extraction begins automatically
3. **UI Display**: File explorer shows processing status, progress indicator appears on document
4. **Content Analysis**: AI analyzes extracted content to generate summary and metadata
5. **Final Outcome**: Document shows "processed" status with enhanced metadata available for context selection

### Success State
User sees:
- Document processing completed with success indicator in file explorer
- Enhanced document metadata available when hovering over files
- Improved context selection relevance when using processed documents
- Document summaries available in context tooltips and selection interfaces

### Error Handling Flow
- **Extraction Error**: Unsupported format or corrupted file → Processing fails gracefully → User notified with clear error message
- **Analysis Error**: AI analysis fails → Basic metadata preserved → User can retry processing or use document without analysis
- **Processing Timeout**: Large document processing exceeds time limits → Processing cancelled → User offered options to retry or use unprocessed
