# Workspace Core Integration

## Context Snapshot
```yaml
module: Workspace Core
dependencies: [LibreChat Authentication, LibreChat File System, LibreChat Database]
patterns_used: []
code_templates: []
ui_references: []
constraints: [Non-invasive LibreChat extension, Local state only (no persistence), Fork compatibility]
```

## Assumptions
- LibreChat authentication system is fully functional
- LibreChat's MongoDB models and file handling are operational
- React Router and component architecture are established
- User sessions and JWT authentication are working
- LibreChat's workspace structure supports extensions

## Purpose

This feature establishes the foundational workspace organization capabilities within the NIC Insight LibreChat distribution, enabling users to create logical project boundaries around related documents and conversations. It provides the core infrastructure for document organization, project management, and workspace-scoped operations that all other NIC Insight features depend upon, while maintaining complete compatibility with LibreChat's existing functionality.

## Scope

### Included Capabilities
- Workspace creation and naming within user sessions
- Project hierarchy organization with folders and subfolders
- File organization within workspace boundaries
- Workspace switching with context preservation
- Basic workspace metadata management (name, description, creation date)
- Integration with LibreChat's existing file upload system
- Workspace-scoped file tree navigation
- Project-based conversation organization

### Excluded from This Feature
- Real file system persistence (local state only per requirements)
- Collaboration features between users
- Advanced workspace templates or automation
- Integration with external file systems or cloud storage
- Workspace sharing or permission management beyond user ownership

## User Flow

### Primary Flow
1. **Initial Trigger**: User accesses NIC Insight interface or creates first workspace
2. **System Processing**: System initializes workspace context and displays workspace creation interface
3. **UI Interaction**: User creates workspace with name and optional description
4. **Workspace Activation**: System sets new workspace as active context
5. **Final Outcome**: User sees workspace interface with empty project structure ready for file organization

### Success State
User sees an active workspace with:
- Workspace name displayed in activity bar
- Empty project tree in file explorer
- Workspace context available for document uploads
- Chat interface workspace-aware

### Error Handling Flow
- **Workspace Creation Error**: Invalid workspace name → System validates and shows error → User corrects input
- **Context Switch Error**: Failed workspace activation → System maintains previous workspace → User notified of issue
- **File Organization Error**: Invalid file structure → System prevents operation → User guided to valid structure

## Data Models

### Core Data Entities
```yaml
Workspace:
  fields:
    id: string # UUID for workspace identification
    name: string # User-defined workspace name (required, 1-100 chars)
    description: string # Optional workspace description (max 500 chars)
    userId: string # Owner ID from LibreChat auth
    createdAt: Date # Creation timestamp
    lastAccessedAt: Date # Last access tracking
    isActive: boolean # Currently active workspace
  relationships:
    projects: Project[] # One-to-many relationship with projects
    files: WorkspaceFile[] # One-to-many relationship with files
  constraints:
    - name must be unique per user
    - only one workspace can be active per user session
    - workspace deletion removes all associated projects and files
```

### Supporting Data Structures
```yaml
Project:
  fields:
    id: string # UUID for project identification
    name: string # Project name (required, 1-100 chars)
    path: string # Virtual path within workspace
    parentId: string # Parent project ID for hierarchy
    workspaceId: string # Foreign key to workspace
    type: string # 'folder' | 'project'
    createdAt: Date # Creation timestamp
  validation:
    - name must be valid file system name
    - path must be unique within workspace
    - parent hierarchy must not create cycles

WorkspaceFile:
  fields:
    id: string # UUID for file identification
    name: string # Original filename
    path: string # Virtual path within workspace
    projectId: string # Associated project ID
    workspaceId: string # Associated workspace ID
    mimeType: string # File MIME type
    size: number # File size in bytes
    uploadedAt: Date # Upload timestamp
    libreFileId: string # Reference to LibreChat file record
  validation:
    - filename must be valid and safe
    - path must be unique within workspace
    - mimeType must be in LibreChat's allowed types
```
