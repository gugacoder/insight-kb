## Summary

**Task Status Legend:**
* [ ] ~ Task pending (not started)
* [-] ~ Task in progress (currently executing)
* [x] ~ Task completed successfully
* [!] ~ Task failed with errors

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. Asset Management System → All other components depend on optimized asset pipeline
2. Color System → Typography and UI Components require color foundation
3. Brand Identity → Must be implemented before UI component styling
4. Component Styling → Required before application integration
5. Testing → Must validate all implementations before deployment

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Each phase includes validation checkpoints
- Dependencies are clearly defined to prevent implementation conflicts
- Rollback procedures are documented for each major change
- Performance monitoring ensures no degradation during implementation

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Phase 0-1: 1-2 weeks (Foundation)
- Phase 2-3: 2-3 weeks (Core Implementation)
- Phase 4-5: 1-2 weeks (Integration & Testing)
- Phase 6-7: 1 week (Deployment)
- **Total: 5-8 weeks for complete implementation**

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% visual transformation from LibreChat to Insight KB branding
- Maintained or improved performance metrics
- Full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Zero functionality regressions
- Comprehensive documentation and monitoring in place
