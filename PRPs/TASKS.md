# TASKS

## Quality Assessment

**Generated:** 4 Features  
**Examples created:** NIC Brand Integration Patterns, Component Styling Templates  
**Modules documented:** Brand Identity, Color System, Typography, UI Components, Asset Management  
**Autonomous execution confidence:** 8/10  
**Reason:** Comprehensive specifications with detailed technical implementation, clear dependencies, and thorough validation procedures. Minor risk areas include specific brand asset optimization requirements and cross-component integration testing.

## Summary

**Task Status Legend:**
* [ ] ~ Task pending (not started)
* [-] ~ Task in progress (currently executing)
* [x] ~ Task completed successfully
* [!] ~ Task failed with errors

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. Asset Management System → All other components depend on optimized asset pipeline
2. Color System → UI Components require color foundation
3. Brand Identity → Must be implemented before UI component styling
4. Component Styling → Required before application integration
5. Testing → Must validate all implementations before deployment

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Each phase includes validation checkpoints
- Dependencies are clearly defined to prevent implementation conflicts
- Rollback procedures are documented for each major change
- Performance monitoring ensures no degradation during implementation

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% visual transformation from LibreChat to NIC Insight branding
- Maintained or improved performance metrics
- Full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Zero functionality regressions
- Comprehensive documentation in place
