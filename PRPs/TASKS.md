## Summary

**Task Status Legend:**
* [ ] ~ Task pending (not started)
* [-] ~ Task in progress (currently executing)
* [x] ~ Task completed successfully
* [!] ~ Task failed with errors

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. Asset Management System → All other components depend on optimized asset pipeline
2. Color System → UI Components require color foundation
3. Brand Identity → Must be implemented before UI component styling
4. Component Styling → Required before application integration
5. Testing → Must validate all implementations before deployment

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Each phase includes validation checkpoints
- Dependencies are clearly defined to prevent implementation conflicts
- Rollback procedures are documented for each major change
- Performance monitoring ensures no degradation during implementation

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% visual transformation from LibreChat to NIC Insight branding
- Maintained or improved performance metrics
- Full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Zero functionality regressions
- Comprehensive documentation in place
