# No Document Found for Query on Role

## **ISSUE**

LibreChat fails to start or function properly with the following error:
```
2025-08-11T19:22:36.965Z error: There was an uncaught error: No document found for query "{ _id: new ObjectId('689822d966543958f7e9ad66') }" on model "Role"
```

**Symptoms:**
- LibreChat attempts to search for a specific Role that doesn't exist in the database
- System may fail during login process
- Orphaned references from old sessions are causing the problem
- Backend service cannot start properly

## **RESOLUTION**

**Step 1: Identify Database Parameters**

Check your `.env` file to find the MONGO_URI and extract the host and database name.
Example: `MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/InsightKB`
- host: `mongo`
- port: `27017`
- database-name: `InsightKB`

**Step 2: Connect to MongoDB**

```bash
mongosh mongodb://{host}:{port}
```

**Step 3: Clean Corrupted Sessions**

Execute these three commands in sequence:

```bash
use {database-name}  # replace with your actual database name

db.sessions.deleteMany({})

# Se existir uma collection de tokens, limpar tamb√©m
# db.refreshtokens.deleteMany({})

exit
```

**Step Two: Notify the User**

Clearly inform the user that they need to restart the backend service for the changes to take effect.
