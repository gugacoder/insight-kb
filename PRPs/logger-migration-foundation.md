# PRP: Logger Migration Foundation

## Role

You are a **Node.js Backend Systems Architect** with expertise in logging infrastructure and dependency management. Your responsibility is to establish the foundational migration patterns from RAGE's custom logging system to LibreChat's Winston logger while preserving all critical functionality.

**Required Expertise:**
- Winston logging framework and transport configuration
- Node.js module dependency resolution and circular dependency prevention
- Structured logging patterns and metadata management
- Performance monitoring and correlation ID systems
- Enterprise logging best practices and sanitization

**Context Awareness:**
- Understanding of existing RAGE logger architecture and features
- Knowledge of LibreChat's Winston configuration and capabilities
- Familiarity with circular dependency issues in Node.js modules
- Security considerations for sensitive data logging
- Performance implications of logging infrastructure changes

## Objective

**Primary Goal:** Establish robust foundation patterns for migrating RAGE system from custom RageLogger to LibreChat's Winston logger while maintaining all essential logging capabilities.

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Correlation ID system maintained and enhanced
- [ ] Service tagging framework implemented (`service: 'rage'`)
- [ ] Structured logging format preserved and standardized
- [ ] Sensitive data sanitization preserved
- [ ] Performance tracking capabilities maintained
- [ ] Context metadata management system migrated

- **Future Considerations:** Advanced metrics integration, log aggregation optimization

## Motivation

**Business Value:**
- Eliminates critical circular dependency causing initialization failures
- Consolidates logging infrastructure reducing maintenance overhead
- Improves system reliability and startup timing
- Enables better log integration and monitoring across entire application

**Problem Statement:**
- Current circular dependency between ConfigManager and RageLogger causes timing issues and system failures
- Duplicate logging infrastructure increases complexity and maintenance burden
- Custom logger lacks enterprise-grade features available in LibreChat's Winston setup
- Inconsistent logging patterns across different system components

**Strategic Importance:**
- Critical blocker for RAGE system stability and production deployment
- Foundation for broader system consolidation and standardization
- Enables future observability and monitoring enhancements
- Reduces technical debt and improves developer experience

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero initialization timing failures
- 100% preservation of existing logging functionality
- Reduced codebase complexity (removal of custom logger)
- Improved log consistency and integration

## Context

### Technical Environment

**Architecture:**
- Node.js backend with modular microservice-style components
- LibreChat application with established Winston logging infrastructure
- RAGE system as integrated component requiring seamless logging
- Production environment with enterprise logging requirements

**Current Codebase:**

- **LibreChat Winston**: `api/config/winston.js` - enterprise Winston configuration
- **Config System**: `rageapi/config/index.js` - circular dependency at line 4
- **Integration Points**: Multiple RAGE components using custom logger

### Dependencies and Constraints

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Winston logging framework (already installed in LibreChat)
- Node.js path resolution for cross-module imports
- Existing log file rotation and retention policies
- Correlation ID generation and management systems

**Business Constraints:**
- Zero downtime migration requirement
- Preservation of all audit and compliance logging
