const { CorrelationManager } = require('./logging/correlation');

class RageOperation {
  async execute(options = {}) {
    const correlationId = options.correlationId || 
      CorrelationManager.generate('rage-operation');
    
    const context = CorrelationManager.createContext(correlationId, {
      operation: 'enrichMessage',
      userId: options.userId,
      sessionId: options.sessionId
    });
    
    try {
      // Operation with correlation tracking
      CorrelationManager.setActiveContext(correlationId, context);
      const result = await this.performOperation();
      return result;
    } finally {
      CorrelationManager.clearContext(correlationId);
    }
  }
}
```

**Structured Metadata Framework:**
```javascript
// Metadata builder with validation
const { MetadataBuilder } = require('./logging/metadata');

const metadata = new MetadataBuilder()
  .setService('rage')
  .setComponent('interceptor')
  .setOperation('enrichMessage')
  .setCorrelationId(correlationId)
  .addPerformanceMetric('duration', 150)
  .addContext('userId', userId)
  .addContext('messageLength', message.length)
  .sanitize()
  .build();

logger.info('Message enrichment completed', metadata);
```

**Performance Tracking Integration:**
```javascript
// Performance tracking with structured logging
const { PerformanceTracker } = require('./logging/performance');

const tracker = new PerformanceTracker('enrichMessage', correlationId);
tracker.start();

// ... operation execution ...

tracker.end({
  documentsRetrieved: results.length,
  relevanceScore: avgScore,
  optimizationApplied: true
});

// Automatically logs structured performance data
```
