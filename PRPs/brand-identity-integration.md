## Objective

**Primary Goal:** Transform LibreChat's core visual identity elements (logo, favicon, application title) to reflect the NIC Insight/NIC brand identity as specified in the brand guidelines.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Replace LibreChat logo with NIC logo variants
- [ ] Update all favicon formats with NIC branding
- [ ] Change application title from "LibreChat" to "NIC Insight"
- [ ] Implement proper logo variants for light/dark themes

- **Future Considerations:** Brand animation or interactive logo elements

## Motivation

**Business Value:**
- Establishes clear brand identity for NIC Insight platform
- Creates professional and cohesive user experience
- Differentiates from original LibreChat branding
- Supports marketing and brand recognition efforts

**Problem Statement:**
- Current application displays LibreChat branding throughout interface
- Users see LibreChat name and logo instead of NIC Insight identity
- Favicon and browser metadata still reference original LibreChat brand
- Inconsistent brand representation across different interface states

**Strategic Importance:**
- Foundation for complete brand transformation
- Critical for user trust and professional appearance
- Essential for platform launch and marketing initiatives
- High visibility change affecting all user touchpoints

**Success Metrics:**
- 100% replacement of LibreChat visual identity elements
- Consistent brand presentation across all browser states
- Optimized asset loading performance (< 2s load time)
- Cross-platform favicon compatibility

## Context

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 1: Asset Preparation and Analysis

**Objective:** Prepare brand assets and analyze current implementation

**Tasks:**

1. **Audit Current Asset Structure**

   * **Input:** Existing LibreChat assets in `client/public/assets/`
   * **Output:** Complete inventory of logo and favicon usage
   * **Validation:** All asset references documented

2. **Prepare NIC Brand Assets**

   * **Input:** Brand assets from `PRPs/Examples/`
   * **Output:** Web-optimized asset variants in required formats
   * **Validation:** Assets meet performance and quality standards

3. **Generate Missing Asset Formats**

   * **Input:** Source NIC logo files
   * **Process:**
     * Use an SVG processor to convert the selected NIC SVG logo into the same format, resolution, and optimization standard as the current asset it will replace
     * Choose apropriate base format based on the SVG flles available in the document `NIC Insight Brand.md`
   * **Output:** Complete favicon set (16x16, 32x32, 180x180, 192x192, maskable)
   * **Validation:** All PWA and browser requirements satisfied

4. **Logo Dimension & Format Verification and SVG Processing**

   * **Input:** Existing and new NIC logo files (SVG, PNG, ICO)
   * **Process:**
     * Check dimensions and file formats of all current LibreChat and NIC logos
     * Validate that replacement assets match expected size ratios and resolutions
     * Use an SVG processor to convert the selected NIC SVG logo into the same format, resolution, and optimization standard as the current asset it will replace
   * **Output:** Fully standardized NIC logo files, ready for direct substitution in the application
   * **Validation:** Replacement assets maintain aspect ratio, pass visual QA, and are optimized for web performance

### Phase 2: Core Brand Asset Implementation
**Objective:** Replace primary brand assets with NIC equivalents

**Tasks:**
1. **Replace Primary Logo**
   - **Input:** Optimized NIC logo SVG
   - **Output:** Updated `client/public/assets/logo.svg`
   - **Validation:** Logo displays correctly in application interface

2. **Update Favicon Assets**
   - **Input:** Generated favicon formats
   - **Output:** Replaced favicon files in `client/public/assets/`
   - **Validation:** Favicons display correctly in browser tabs

3. **Modify Application Title**
   - **Input:** "NIC Insight" title specification
   - **Output:** Updated `client/index.html` title tag
   - **Validation:** Browser title displays "NIC Insight"

### Phase 3: Theme-Aware Logo Implementation
**Objective:** Implement proper logo variants for light/dark themes

**Tasks:**
1. **Implement Logo Theme Variants**
